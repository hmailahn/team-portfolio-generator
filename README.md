## Description
Team Profile Generator is a great tool for a manager to create a webpage that display's their team's basic info so that they can have easy access to employees emails and github profiles.

## Usage
To use this Team Profile Generator, clone the repository onto your own machine. Make sure to install the npm inquirer package by running "npm install" as well as "npm i inquirer" in your terminal. If you want to run the tests then you will also want to install jest "npm i jest". To run this application, simply type "node index" in the terminal. A series of questions will prompt the user, first about the manager, then a user can add multiple employees that are either interns or engineers. Once a user is done adding to their team, an html  file will populate. On this file are the card members of the users team. Here you can see names, ids, emails, github accounts (for engineers), and school (for interns).
